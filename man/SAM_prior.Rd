\description{
The \code{SAM_prior} function is designed to display the SAM prior, given
the informative prior (constructed from historical data), non-informative
prior, and the mixture weight calculated using \code{\link{SAM_weight}}
function (\emph{Yang, et al., 2023}).
}
\details{
SAM prior is constructed by mixing an informative prior
\eqn{\pi_1(\theta)}, constructed based on historical data, with a
non-informative prior \eqn{\pi_0(\theta)} using the mixture weight
\eqn{w} determined by \code{\link{SAM_weight}} function to achieve the
degree of prior-data conflict (\emph{Schmidli et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2023}).

 Let \eqn{\theta} and \eqn{\theta_h} denote the treatment effects
 associated with the current arm data \eqn{D} and historical data \eqn{D_h},
 respectively. Let \eqn{\delta} denote the clinically significant difference
 such that if \eqn{|\theta_h - \theta| \ge \delta}, then \eqn{\theta_h} is
 regarded as clinically distinct from \eqn{\theta}, and it is therefore
 inappropriate to borrow any information from \eqn{D_h}. Consider two
 hypotheses:

 \deqn{H_0: \theta = \theta_h, ~ H_1: \theta = \theta_h + \delta ~ or ~  \theta = \theta_h - \delta.}
 \eqn{H_0} represents that \eqn{D_h} and \eqn{D} are consistent (i.e.,
 no prior-data conflict) and thus information borrowing is desirable,
 whereas \eqn{H_1} represents that the treatment effect of \eqn{D}
 differs from \eqn{D_h} to such a degree that no information should be
 borrowed.

 The SAM prior uses the likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistics \eqn{R} to
 quantify the degree of prior-data conflict and determine the extent of
 information borrowing.

 \deqn{R = P(D | H_0, \theta_h) / P(D | H_1, \theta_h) = P(D | \theta = \theta_h) / \max(P(D | \theta = \theta_h + \delta), P(D | \theta = \theta_h - \delta)) ,}
 where \eqn{P(D | \cdot)} denotes the likelihood function. An alternative
 Bayesian choice is the posterior probability ratio (PPR):

 \deqn{R = P(D | H_0, \theta_h) / P(D | H_1, \theta_h) = P(H_0) / P( H_1) \times BF, }
 where \eqn{P(H_0)} and \eqn{P(H_1)} is the prior probabilities of \eqn{H_0}
 and \eqn{H_1} being true. \eqn{BF} is the Bayes Factor that in this case
 is the same as the LRT.

 The SAM prior, denoted as \eqn{\pi_{sam}(\theta)}, is then defined
 as a mixture of an informative prior \eqn{\pi_1(\theta)}, constructed
 based on \eqn{D_h} and a non-informative prior \eqn{\pi_0(\theta)}:

 \deqn{\pi_{sam}(\theta) = w\pi_1(\theta) + (1-w)\pi_0(\theta),}
 where the mixture weight \eqn{w} is calculated as:

 \deqn{w = R / (1 + R).}

 As the level of prior-data conflict increases, the likelihood ratio
 \eqn{R} decreases, resulting in a decrease in the weight \eqn{w}
 assigned to the informative prior and thus a decrease in information
 borrowing. As a result, \eqn{\pi_{sam}(\theta)} is data-driven and
 has the ability to self-adapt the information borrowing based on the
 degree of prior-data conflict.

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{SAM_prior(betaMix)}: The function calculates the SAM prior for beta
mixture distribution. The default \code{nf.prior} is set to be
\code{mixbeta(c(1,1,1))} which represents a uniform prior \code{Beta(1,1)}.

\item \code{SAM_prior(gammaMix)}: The function calculates the SAM prior for gamma
mixture distribution. The default \code{nf.prior} is set to be
\code{mixgamma(c(1,0.001,0.001))} which represents a vague gamma prior
\code{Gamma(0.001,0.001)}.

\item \code{SAM_prior(normMix)}: The function calculates the SAM prior for normal
mixture distribution. The default \code{nf.prior} is set to be
\code{mixnorm(c(1,summary(if.prior)['mean'], sigma))} which represents a
unit-information prior.
