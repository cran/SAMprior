The default method is LRT (Likelihood Ratio Test), the alternative option can
be PPR (Posterior Probability Ratio). See \code{\link{SAM_weight}} for more
details.}

the prior probability of \eqn{H_1} being true using PPR method. The default

robust MAP prior for comparison, the default value is \code{FALSE}.}

(\eqn{0 \leq} \code{weight} \eqn{\leq 1}) for the robust MAP prior,

\value{
Returns dataframe that contains the relative bias, relative MSE,
type I error, and power for both SAM priors, as well as robust MAP priors.
Additionally, the mixture weight of the SAM prior is also displayed.

\description{
The \code{get_OC} function is designed to generate the operating
characteristics of SAM priors (\emph{Yang, et al., 2023}), including the
relative bias, relative mean squared error, and type I error and power
under a two-arm comparative trial design. As an option, the operating
characteristic of robust MAP priors (\emph{Schmidli, et al., 2014})
can also be generated for comparison.

\details{
The \code{get_OC} function is designed to generate the operating
characteristics of SAM priors, including the relative bias, relative
mean squared error, and type I error, and power under a two-arm
comparative trial design. As an option, the operating characteristics of
robust MAP priors (\emph{Schmidli, et al., 2014}) can also be generated for
comparison.

The relative bias is defined as the difference between the bias of a method
and the bias of using a non-informative prior. The relative mean squared
error is the difference between the mean squared error (MSE) of a method and
the MES of using a non-informative prior.

To evaluate type I error and power, the determination of whether the
treatment is superior to the control is calculated based on function
 \code{\link[RBesT]{decision2S}}.

## Consider a randomized comparative trial designed to borrow information
## from historical data on the control. We assumed a non-informative prior
## beta(1, 1) and an informative prior beta(30, 50) after incorporating
## the historical data. The treatment is regarded as superior to the control
## if Pr(RR.t > RR.c | data) > 0.95, where RR.t and RR.c are response rates
##  of the treatment and control, respectively. The operating characteristics
##  were assessed under the scenarios of (RR.c, RR.t) = (0.3, 0.36) and (0.3, 0.56).
